This is the derivation of both the closed form and gradient descent solution of linear regression

RSS is simply the squared difference between target $y$ and estimated value $\hat{y}$
 
$$\sum(y-\hat{y})^2$$

Remember that $\hat{y}$ is equal to $b_0+b_1x$ so we can expand this further into
$$\sum(y-(b_0+b_1x))^2$$
