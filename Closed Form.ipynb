    "The great thing about this function is that it always have a global minimum. This is confirmed by calculus by setting the derivation of the RSS function to zero. From calculus we know that the RSS function is a concave function, which means that it must have a unique, global minimum. That is the sole reason why we can have the closed form equation, i.e. unique solution that corresponds to the global minimum. However, RSS is a special case where the derivation can be set to zero so we could obtain the parameter. More often than not, we could not do this. So take this closed form solution with a little bit grain of salt"
